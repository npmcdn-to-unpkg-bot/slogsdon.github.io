## Short Version

I'm a polyglot web developer. Current interests include
Elixir/Erlang, Go, Haskell, Lua, and DevOps when necessary.

I have limited availability for contract projects and am
currently not looking for new full-time opportunities.
[Send me an email](/contact/#email) if you'd like to discuss
a project with me.

## Long Version

In progess. :)
