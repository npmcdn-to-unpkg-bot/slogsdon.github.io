## Short Version

I'm a polyglot web developer. Current interests include
Elixir/Erlang, Go, Haskell, Lua, and DevOps when necessary.

I have limited availability for contract projects and am
currently not looking for new full-time opportunities.
[Send me an email](/contact/#email) if you'd like to discuss
a project with me.

## Long Version

I am a polyglot developer striving to build performant and
scalable applications and libraries targeted for the web.

I have building building applications for the web since
2003, when I was enrolled in a "Web Programming" class in
high school. The course was supposed to cover only HTML
and CSS, but myself and a few others were offered to learn
PHP instead because of our quick grasp of the basics. I've
been tinkering with and learning web programming on my own
ever since.

Professionally, I have developed for a variety of companies
ranging from individuals and startups to agencies and
financial instutions in a variety of programming languages,
including C# and VB.NET, PHP, and Elixir.

My current passions include improving developer efficiency
and experience, functional programming (in the form of
Elixir, Erlang, and Haskell), and writing resilient code
(whether by architecture choice, testing, or leveraging
language/platform traits).
