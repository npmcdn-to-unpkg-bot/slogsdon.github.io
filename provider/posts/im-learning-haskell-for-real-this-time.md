About a couple of years ago, I was looking for something to add to my metaphoric programming toolbox. That something needed to push me beyond PHP and C#. My initial desires were performance related (I mean PHP isn't really known for it's blistering speed), and as I thought about the possibilities, a paradigm shift wasn't out of the question.

## Go for a bit

To keep things a bit easier for myself, my first stop was something that resembled what I already knew: [Go][go]. As "an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software", I figured it be right up my alley with what I was trying to achieve.

I found a web framework to use ([revel][revel]) and built a basic blog that resembled [Obtvse 2][obtvse2]. The simplicity of the language make the work quick, and I felt efficient which isn't always the case when I come across a new language. I went on to create a few learning projects in the language, contributing (or attempting to) to open source projects when I saw fit, but yet, I felt there was something off about the way things were going. *N.B. I later came to know this was because of my use of a rigid framework when starting to use Go, so I wasn't feeling close to the language itself.*

## Haskell intro

Venturing on, I decided to try this thing I'd been hearing a lot about: [Haskell][haskell]. According to its homepage, "Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software", and that's every software developer's goal, right?

Probably sometime between [Cabal Hell][cabal-hell], trying to wrap my head around monads, and deciphering all of the operators in use in Haskell source files, I started drifting away from learning Haskell. I remained interested in what it offered, but I was impatient and didn't have the extra time to devote to everything that revolves around the language.
