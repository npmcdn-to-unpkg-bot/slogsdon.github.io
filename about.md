## Short Version

I'm a polyglot web developer. Current interests include Elixir/Erlang, Go, Haskell, Lua, and DevOps when necessary.

I have limited availability for contract projects and am currently not looking for new full-time opportunities. [Send me an email][1] if you'd like to discuss a project with me.

## Long Version

I am a polyglot developer striving to build performant and scalable applications and libraries targeted for the web.

I have building building applications for the web since 2003, when I was enrolled in a "Web Programming" class in high school. The course was supposed to cover only HTML and CSS, but myself and a few others were offered to learn PHP instead because of our quick grasp of the basics. I've been tinkering with and learning web programming on my own ever since.

Professionally, I have developed for a variety of companies ranging from individuals and startups to agencies and financial institutions in a variety of programming languages, including C# and VB.NET, PHP, and Elixir.

My current passions include improving developer efficiency and experience, functional programming (in the form of Elixir, Erlang, and Haskell), and writing resilient code (whether by architecture choice, testing, or leveraging language/platform traits).
